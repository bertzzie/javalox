# Lox Interpreter

A simple implementation of Lox interpreter from the [CraftingInterpreter](http://craftinginterpreters.com) book.

This is an exercise repo, meant to implement what's in the book with some addition:

- All challenges completed
- Better repl with syntax highlighting, etc
- Language Server to integrate with editors / IDE
- Static analysis tool

## Current State

Right now the interpreter can:

- parse and execute statements
- assign global variable

More will come:
